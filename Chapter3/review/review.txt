1. What is meant by the term 'prompt'?
    A prompt is something where a user can type something to the terminal

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable
    The input operator >>

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named 'number',
    what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program?

    First line to prompt the user to input a number:    cout << "Please write a number and confirm with 'enter'\n";
    Second line to read the variable:                   cin >> number;

4. What is \n called what purpose does it serve?
    \n is used to make a linebreak. It's called newline

5. What terminates input into a string?
    Whitespace (space,newline or tabulator) is needed to terminate a string

6. What terminates input into an integer?
    Everything that is not a number, aslong the input started with a number.
    For example: 22 Carlos -> 22

7. How would you write?

cout << "Hello, ";
cout << first_name;
cout << "!\n";

in a single line of code?
    cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

8. What is an object?
    An object is an instance of a class which contains the attributes and methods of the class but is it's own entity in the memory.
    For example a string has an attribute that has the string length and one attribute that has a char sequence.

9. What is a literal?
    A literal is the value of a variable. If we have:
        string name = "Alex";
    the literal would be 'Alex'!

10. What kinds of literals are there?
    Numbers, strings or a character

11. What is a variable?
    A variable is something where we can store a value in. It is defined explicitly by a type in C++. But that differs per programming language!

12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
    char = 1 Byte
    int = 4 Byte 
    double = 8 Byte

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
    Bit or Byte (8-bit) 

14. What is the difference between = and ==?
    = can be used to assign or initialize (although not recommended) variables.
    == is the 'is equal' operator which can be used to return a boolean

15. What is a definition?
    A definition is when you declare a variable and initialize it with a value

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
    An initialization is done when defining a variable:
    int number {0}; // initialized number with 0
    an assignment is done when I change the value of the currently stored value of an variable:
    number = 5; // assigned 5 to number (previously 0)

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
    String concatenation is when you add a string to another one making it one new string.
    You can either use the + operator or the += operator if you want to concat an existing string in a variable with a new one.

18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?
    This_little_pig - legal
    This_1_is fine - not legal, because whitespaces are not allowed in variables
    2_For_1_special - not legal, because names are not allowed to start with a number
    latest thing - not legal, because whitespaces are not allowed in variables
    the_$12_method - not legal, because special characters like $ are not allowed in variables
    _this_is_ok - legal, but you shouldn't use it, because those are used for system entities or other important implementation which could be overwritten
    MiniMineMin - legal 
    number - legal
    correct? - not legal, because question marks are not letters and special characters are not allowed

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they are likely to cause confusion.
    s   _foo    scCf    dumb_function   blehv12313

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?
    Not too long but descriptive. Instead of making a sentence, use 2 - 3 words that describe the variable.

21. What is type safety and why is it important?
    Type safety is, when a variable is defined and initialized with a value from the start, as forgetting it might lead to unexpected behaviour.

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
    Because information is lost when conversing and the number is always round down, giving inaccurate information. 

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
    If it fits into the memory size of a type, it's safe to converse.
